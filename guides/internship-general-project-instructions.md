General project instructions (READ CAREFULLY!)
================================================

A developer is assigned to each project or individual and you'll be working with that developer for your tasks and also your questions/concerns. Throughout this document we refer to this developer *your assigned developer*.

The tasks are posted in the project page (link given to you through email). You are also assigned a branch (based on your name) to work in. Your branch name is also given to you through email.

When you are assigned a task:

* Clone your branch (refer to [this guide](/guides/quickstart-git) for a handy guide on Git)
  

* Do your task. Any question? type your question in the task description asa comment and tag your assigned developer (@username)
  

* Commit and push the changes to the branch and make a pull request. Use the same as the task for the pull request.
  

* **Assign this pull request to the task (using the right menu when creating the pull request)** Here is a screenshot of the menu:

  ALMOST EVERYONE EVERYTIME FORGETS TO DO THIS!!!!

* If you have a general question make a new issue (in the repository) and tag your assigned developer there.
  

* Your assigned developer will review your pull request by writing comments for your lines of code in the pull request. You will find them in the pull request conversation tab. Make the changes as requested in the pull request review and once the changes are ok we will merge it and your task is done.
  

* Throughout the review process there would be new concepts/topics, and you may be asked to read some articles to learn more about them,
  

* After finishing your task you will be doing a *follow-up* activity, which is in fact a learning module. You will be asked to write a brief summary of what you learned about some topics related to the task. It may require you to do some online research as well. You will write your answers in markdown language.
