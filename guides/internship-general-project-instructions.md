General project instructions (READ CAREFULLY!)
================================================

A developer is assigned to each project or individual and you'll be working with that developer for your tasks and also your questions/concerns. Throughout this document we refer to this developer *your assigned developer*.

The tasks are posted in the project page (link given to you through email). You are also assigned a branch (based on your name) to work in. Your branch name is also given to you through email.

When you are assigned a task:

* Clone your branch (refer to [this guide](/guides/quickstart-git) for a handy guide on Git)


* Do your task. Any questions? type your question in the task description asa comment and tag your assigned developer (@username)


* Commit and push the changes to the branch and make a pull request. Use the same as the task for the pull request.


* **Assign this pull request to the task (using the right menu when creating the pull request)** Here is a screenshot of the menu:

  ALMOST EVERYONE EVERY TIME FORGETS TO DO THIS!!!!

* If you have a general question, make a new issue (in the repository) and tag your assigned developer there.


* Your assigned developer will review your pull request by writing comments for your lines of code in the pull request. You will find them in the pull request conversation tab. Make the changes as requested in the pull request review and once the changes are ok we will merge it and your task is done.


* Throughout the review process there would be new concepts/topics, and you may be asked to read some articles to learn more about them,


* After finishing your task you will be doing a *follow-up* activity, which is in fact a learning module. You will be asked to write a brief summary of what you learned about some topics related to the task. It may require you to do some online research as well. You will write your answers in markdown language.

Method of communication with us
------------------------------------
It is VERY IMPORTANT to know how we can message each other back and forth during the program:

1. Messaging on the development platform. Depending on which platform we are using (Github, Gitlab, etc.) we use that platform to message each other by "tagging" the person's name either in an issue box or a pull request box (and some platforms also offer direct messaging). You can enable the email notification option on these platforms so that you receive email when someone tags you (or you may choose to check the platform frequently, up to you)


2. Emails from *devs@appers-lab.ca* We use this email address to send general announcements and instructions. It is important that you make sure you receive emails from this address (make sure it is not categorized as spam). The emails may include important stuff like new projects, new tasks, surveys, learning materials, etc. They are NOT marketing waste-of-time jolly announcements, they are really important!


About the internship program
---------------------------------
Appers lab has decided to engage new graduates and self-learners into its real-world projects as a step to close the gap between newbies and industry (industry is known to be hostile to people with no experience!). That being said, it is important to keep in mind that this program is NOT for ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS! You are supposed to know at least the basis of the tools and frameworks that you are working on. You should have gathered as many theoretical knowledge as possible during your college/self study, and now this program is here to give you EXPERIENCE by engaging you in a real-world project. This program should be considered as an *advanced course* in development.

Elements of this program:

* You will be assigned (or self-assigned) tasks from a variety of tasks we have. The tasks we make for interns are rather simplified with extensive description. As you make more progress we will reduce the amount of descriptions to make it more real-world, and then you will need to figure out some details by yourself


* Code review. Our developers will do code review for you, and may refer you to more readings if need be.


* Team project. We do not add too much Agile formality to the internship program, but you will be working in a team environment using common platforms such as Github or Gitlab and their project management tools. You need to know the basis of these platforms such as making pull requests, making issues, linking PR with issues, checking the project pages, self-assigning tasks, etc.


* Group activity. For the first few weeks you may be working individually with your assigned developer only. But we may also have group tasks where you will be working in a small team of other interns, and this gives you even more experience for team work.


* Social events. Even though now it is more limited than ever, we try to have at least some online casual meetings so that the team gets to know each other.


* Weekly survey. We send you some survey/feedback forms each week or every other week. It is important that you fill them out so that we know how you feel and make improvements as needed.
